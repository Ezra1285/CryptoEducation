        <h3>What is crypto?</h3>
        <p>
          Crypto also short for cryptocurrency can be defined as any medium of
          exchange that operates solely on the internet and which uses
          cryptography to carry out its financial transactions. The main feature
          making crypto currency unique is that it is decentralized. Meaning
          that is it's not controlled by any central authority and is instead
          controlled by a network of computers around the world.
        </p>
        <h3>How does crypto work?</h3>
        <p>
          A easy way to think about crypto currency is to think of it like
          PayPal or a debit card. It's just a digital currency, but the main
          difference is that there is no middleman like there is with other
          digital currencies. Crypto uses a peer-to-peer transaction system,
          meaning the money you send goes directly to the person you send it to.
        </p>
        <h3>What is crypto used for?</h3>
        <p>
          Crypto currencies such as bitcoin can be used to purchase goods and
          services from a variety of places across the world. Some places that
          accept bitcoin are Tesla, Starbucks, Home Depot, Microsoft and even
          New York City's King's College.
        </p>
        <h3>How did crypto start?</h3>
        <p>
          Many people think Bitcoin was the first crypto currency, but in
          reality, the idea had been talked about and attempted by many
          Cryptographers for over a decade before bitcoin launched. While
          Bitcoin wasn't the first, it has been the first to succeed long term.
          Bitcoin was launched in October 2008 with a price of $.08 and has
          since increased to be worth $50,000 per Bitcoin.

        <h3>What is blockchain?</h3>
        <p>
          Blockchain is the technology that crypto currency utilizes in order to
          keep track of all the information that a traditional bank keeps. It
          tracks each account number and the associated balance. In addition,
          its keeps track of where payments are sent from and to.
        </p>
        <h3>How does the blockchain work?</h3>
        <p>
          The blockchain is a very complex idea, but all you need to know are
          the basics of how it operates. In simple term the blockchain is
          digital ledger that is stored in thousands of computers over the
          world. Every time a transaction is made on the blockchain these
          computers all individually process the transaction. If one of the
          systems where to be compromised all the other systems would
          immediately be able to notice, making the blockchain extremely secure.

          <h3>What is Bitcoin?</h3>
          <p>
            Digital currency, virtual currency, and cryptocurrency, all names
            that are commonly used to describe Bitcoin. Bitcoin in simple terms
            is a secure form of digital money that operates on a decentralized
            network.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bitcoin being dementalized means that all Bitcoin transactions are
            sent directly from person to person. This peer-to-peer transaction
            system takes away the middleman in sending or receiving money -
            Meaning there is no need to go through a bank
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no government, financial institution, or central authority
            that owns the decentralized Bitcoin system.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="textWrapped">
          <h3>Why does Bitcoin have value?</h3>
          <p>
            Thought out time there have been hundreds of different objects that
            have been used as money. In the past people have used things such as
            shells, rare metals, and cattle. Money has shown to be any median of
            exchange that people agree has value.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bitcoin's value comes from the fact that people have adopted it. You
            can exchange bitcoin for real-life services and goods, and even
            cash. Bitcoin's use has increased rapidly due to it meeting the 5
            characteristics of a good currency.
          </p>
          <ul class="valueList">
            <li>
              <b>Scarcity: </b>
              Bitcoin is mined(created) at a consistent and predictable rate. As
              time goes on bitcoin becomes more difficult to mine and the amount
              of bitcoin being created becomes less (Similar to mining gold).
              All of this is determined by advanced math and algorithms that are
              available online for anyone.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Durability: </b>
              Bitcoin is a completely digital asset. The benefit is that it can
              not degrade no matter how long or often it's used. Another benefit
              of it being a digit asset is that it cannot be destroyed.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Portability: </b>
              Portability: All Bitcoin are digital and stored on the blockchain.
              Anyone with cell phone and internet connection can access their
              money instantly. Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world almost
              instantly for a small fee.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Divisibility: </b>
              Bitcoin is nearly infinitely divisible - One bitcoin can be split
              into 100 million pieces. These smaller parts of a bitcoin are
              called Satoshi's.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Security (difficult to counterfeit):</b>
              It is mathematically impossible to counterfeit a bitcoin.Bitcoin's
              transactions are run through thousands of computers and servers
              across the world on what is known as the blockchain. It would take
              over 51% of all these computers and erves getting hacked at once
              for bitcoin to be affected. The Bitcoin network has not been
              affected by any attacks since its launch in 2009 (12 years).

          <h3>Is Bitcoin safe?</h3>
          <p>
            Bitcoin security is built around the idea of providing a public,
            cryptographic, permissionless, and most importantly decentralized
            network. Bitcoin's network is built on a secure technology known as
            the blockchain. To better understand all this let's break it into
            sections:
          </p>
          <ul class="valueList">
            <li>
              <b>Cryptographic: </b>
              Bitcoin security uses an advanced mathematical and computer
              calculation for encoding and decoding data called cryptography.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Public: </b>
              All Bitcoin transactions are public information while the people's
              information is kept private. This cuts out any sort of scamming or
              cheating in the system.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Permissionless: </b>
              There is no one party controlling bitcoin. Anyone can send and
              receive bitcoin. There is also no third party who can take actions
              on your behalf such as closing your account or withholding funds.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Decentralized: </b>
              Bitcoin's network is made up of a collection of thousands of
              computers called the blockchain. The blockchain provides many
              systems all over the world compared to having a central bank that
              checks the records only themselves.
