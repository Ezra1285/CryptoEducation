      <h1>The Crypto Dictionary</h1>
      <h2>A list the most common terms you will hear in crypto.</h2>
    </section>

    <section class="termList">
      <h2>Bitcoin</h2>
      <p>
        The first and most valuable cryptocurrency, launched on Jan. 3, 2009.
        While its value has climbed steadily since then, it has seen wild
        fluctuations. In the past months alone, the price of Bitcoin has
        fluctuated from a record high of $60,000 to below $30,000.<small
          >(1)</small
        >
      </p>

      <h2>Bitcoin Cash</h2>
      <p>
        A peer-to-peer electronic cash system that formed from a fork of the
        original Bitcoin. Where Bitcoin is widely accepted as too volatile to be
        useful as a currency, Bitcoin Cash is designed to be better optimized
        for transactions. <small>(1)</small>
      </p>

      <h2>Blockchain</h2>
      <p>
        Blockchain, which consists of a series of blocks, is a digital ledger of
        all the verified transactions made on a particular cryptocurrency.
        <small>(3)</small>
      </p>

      <h2>Cryptocurrency</h2>
      <p>
        A type of currency that's digital and decentralized. Cryptocurrency can
        be used to buy and sell things, or as a long-term store of value.
        <small>(1)</small>
      </p>

      <h2>Decentralization</h2>
      <p>
        Decentralization refers to the property of a system in which nodes or
        actors work in concert in a distributed fashion to achieve a common
        goal.<small>(2)</small>
      </p>

      <h2>Ethereum</h2>
      <p>
        The second largest cryptocurrency by trade volume, Ethereum is a crypto
        network and software platform that developers can use to create new
        applications, and has an associated currency called ether.
        <small>(1)</small>
      </p>

      <h2>Exchange</h2>
      <p>
        Businesses that allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies for fiat money
        or other cryptocurrencies. <small>(2)</small>
      </p>

      <h2>Fork</h2>
      <p>
        A fork is when a cryptocurrency or blockchain-based network splits off
        into two distinct projects with their own code and set of governing
        principles. In the event of a “soft” fork, only one blockchain will
        remain operational, whereas “hard” forks result in two new brand chains.
        For example, Bitcoin Classic is a hard fork of Bitcoin, since both
        cryptocurrencies run on standalone blockchains, with their own sets of
        miners, nodes and network participants.<small>(3)</small>
      </p>

      <h2>Gas</h2>
      <p>
        Gas is the cost of computing power when completing transactions on the
        Ethereum blockchain, which gets passed on to network participants in the
        form of fees.<small>(3)</small>
      </p>

      <h2>Hash</h2>
      <p>
        A unique string of numbers and letters that identify blocks and are tied
        to crypto buyers and sellers. <small>(1)</small>
      </p>

      <h2>Mining</h2>
      <p>
        Mining is the process through which new cryptocurrencies are minted.
        Many cryptocurrencies depend on a proof-of-work mining system, whereby
        computational power is delegated towards solving complex math riddles as
        a way to simultaneously secure and power a network, while also minting
        new tokens. <small>(3)</small>
      </p>

      <h2>Market Capitalization (Market Cap)</h2>
      <p>
        Cryptocurrency market capitalization refers to the total value of all
        the coins that have been mined. You can calculate a crypto's market cap
        by multiplying the current number of coins by the current value of the
        coins.<small>(1)</small>
      </p>

      <h2>Node</h2>
      <p>
        The most basic unit of blockchain infrastructure that stores data.
        <small>(2)</small>
      </p>

      <h2>Peer-to-peer</h2>
      <p>
        The decentralized interactions between parties in a distributed network,
        partitioning tasks or workloads between peers.<small>(2)</small>
      </p>

      <h2>Public Key</h2>
      <p>
        A public key refers to a series of alphanumeric characters used to
        encrypt plain text messages into ciphertext. <small>(2)</small>
      </p>

      <h2>Private Key</h2>
      <p>
        A piece of code generated in asymmetric-key encryption process, paired
        with a public key, to be used in decrypting information hashed with the
        public key.<small>(2)</small>
      </p>

      <h2>Token</h2>
      <p>
        A token refers to a unit of a digital currency like Bitcoin.
        <small>(3)</small>
      </p>

      <h2>Algorithm</h2>
      <p>
        A process or set of rules to be followed in problem-solving or
        calculation operations, usually by a computer.<small>(2)</small>
      </p>

      <h2>Altcoin</h2>
      <p>
        Altcoin means all cryptocurrencies that aren't Bitcoin (and in some
        contexts, Ether). The phrase is used matter-of-factly to describe
        various other cryptocurrencies. <small>(3)</small>
